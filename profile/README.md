Project "PurpleK2" is an OSDev project started by Omar (aka RepubblicaTech) on August of 2024.
Later on January 2025, NotNekoDev joined to collaborate on this project.

Since then, "Kernel 2" (the older codename given to this OS, hence the k2 in the logo) became a mainstream project rather than a simple hobby.
